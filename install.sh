#     --rollback        put back the skills as they were before the last install
#     --version TAG     install another release (default: the one this script is for)

#
# What it does: fetches the release into ~/.onplatform, checks it is the exact
# commit this script was published with, saves your current copies of the
# five skills to ~/.claude/skills/.onplatform-backups/<time>/, then puts the new
# ones in place. Other skills you have are not touched. If you edited one
# of the five yourself, it says so before replacing it; your edit is in
# the backup either way.
