description: How Apple interfaces move — SwiftUI's spring vocabulary (.smooth, .snappy, .bouncy) and when each applies, interruptible and gesture-driven transitions, hero/continuity transitions between screens, microinteractions and haptic pairing, and honouring Reduce Motion. Use when animating anything meant to feel Apple-like, on any platform: a SwiftUI transition, a CSS or Framer Motion animation on the web, a sheet or modal presentation, a button press, a loading or success state, or when a UI is technically correct but feels stiff, floaty, or laggy. Also use when reviewing motion that overshoots, bounces where it shouldn't, or can't be interrupted mid-flight. For Apple's rules on *whether* to animate at all, use apple-hig; for colour, type and control geometry, use apple-ui-kit.

# Apple motion

The HIG covers motion as principle and stops there. Its Motion page has
92 lines on *whether* to animate — purposefully, optionally, following
the gesture — and not one spring parameter. Everything about how the
movement is actually built lives outside it, which is why this exists.

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `references/motion-animation.md` | The spring vocabulary, durations, transition types, interruptibility. |
| `references/microinteractions-feedback.md` | Press states, loading, success and error feedback, haptic pairing. |
| `references/gestures-interaction.md` | Swipe, drag, pinch, edge gestures and how motion should track them. |

## Where each thing comes from

Worth being blunt about, because the three sources have very different
standing and mixing them is how motion advice becomes folklore:

- **Principles → `apple-hig`.** *"Add motion purposefully."* *"Make
  motion optional."* *"Strive for realistic feedback motion that follows
  people's gestures and expectations."* These are Apple's own words, in
  `../apple-hig/references/pages/motion.md`. Quote those, not the
  paraphrases here.
- **Spring names and their behaviour → SwiftUI's API.** `.smooth`,
  `.snappy`, `.bouncy` are real API with real defaults. The bounce
  percentages in `motion-animation.md` are characterisations of them,
  not published constants — treat them as a starting point you tune, and
  don't quote them as Apple's specification.
- **Everything else → observation.** These references came from a
  third-party skill collection and are marked `[observed]` where the
  author inferred behaviour from shipping apps. Useful, not
  authoritative.

Nothing in here is measured the way `apple-ui-kit`'s values are. That
distinction is the point: motion is the part of this repo with the least
ground truth behind it.

## Picking a spring

The one decision that carries most of the feel:

| Spring | Bounce | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `.smooth` | none | Sheets, modals, background transitions — anything that should settle without drawing attention |
| `.snappy` | slight | Button presses, toggles, selection — the default for direct manipulation |
| `.bouncy` | noticeable | Icon presses, arriving notifications, moments meant to feel rewarding |

Bounce is the whole signal. A sheet that bounces reads as toy-like; a
button press that doesn't reads as dead. Getting this one choice right
does more than tuning durations.

## What separates Apple motion from ordinary motion

- **Interruptible.** A gesture must be able to reverse or redirect an
  animation mid-flight rather than queueing behind it. Anything that
  finishes before it will respond feels laggy no matter how fast it is.
- **Tracks the finger, then takes over.** During a drag the surface
  follows the gesture 1:1; the spring only takes over at release,
  carrying the velocity the gesture had. This is the HIG's *"realistic
  feedback motion that follows people's gestures and expectations"* made
  concrete.
- **Duration is a consequence, not an input.** Springs are specified by
  physics and settle when they settle. Reaching for a fixed 300 ms
  usually means reaching for the wrong tool.
- **Position and opacity, not size and colour.** Moving and fading read
  as physical; scaling and recolouring read as effects.

## Reduce Motion is not optional

`apple-hig` states it plainly — *"Make motion optional."* On the web that
is `prefers-reduced-motion`, and it means replacing the movement, not
merely shortening it: cross-fade instead of slide, cut instead of
animate. `apple-ui-kit`'s `ios-components.css` already guards its own
transitions this way; match it.

## Boundaries

- Values — colour, type, control geometry, materials — belong to
  **apple-ui-kit**, measured from Apple's UI kit. Don't restate them
  here; a hex code in a motion file is a hex code that will go stale
  somewhere nobody looks.
- Rules about *whether* a thing should animate, which presentation to
  use, how layouts adapt — **apple-hig**, with the actual quotations.
- This skill covers how the movement itself is built.
