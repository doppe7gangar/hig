# Ask the HIG

The question: $ARGUMENTS

Scripts and references live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/apple-hig/`; below, `H` stands for that folder.

1. **Find the page.** `grep -i "<topic>" H/references/topics.md`. When the
   concern isn't a component (empty states, errors, contrast), look in
   `H/references/concepts.md`, which says where the guidance is filed.
2. **Read it on Apple's site.** `python3 H/hig_page.py <slug>`, with
   `--section "<heading>"` or `--grep <word>` for just the part that answers.
3. **Answer** in your own words with the link. Give every figure with its
   platform, since most tables differ per platform. Quote only a short
   passage you just read, copied exactly.
4. **Check the quotes** before sending: pipe the draft to
   `python3 H/check_quotes.py -`, and fix anything it doesn't call
   VERBATIM or ELIDED.

If the page can't be fetched, say so. Answer from `H/references/numbers.md`
and `concepts.md`, label anything else as your understanding rather than
Apple's statement, and give the link to check.
